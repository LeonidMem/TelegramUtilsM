# TelegramUtilsM
This project includes all utils that I use when creating bots for Telegram.

Now it has:
* **Telegram commands**;
* Lightweight **logger**;
* **UnitTests** which can be created very easily;
* Better **YAML representation**;
* **ConfigUtils** which can load any config only by using one line of code;
* **RepeatingThread** which calls **run** method every **N** milliseconds;
* Some entities like **StaticPredicate** and **TriPredicate**;
* Builder for **HTTP requests**.

# Examples of using:
* [ExchangeRatesM](https://github.com/LeonidMem/ExchangeRatesM) - Bot which updates exchange rates every **N** seconds 
in [@ExchangeRatesM](https://t.me/ExchangeRatesM)
